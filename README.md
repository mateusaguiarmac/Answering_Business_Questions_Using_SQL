# Answering_Business_Questions_Using_SQL

I worked with a modified version of a database called Chinook. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store.

The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables.

In this project, I practiced SQL skills to answer business questions.
